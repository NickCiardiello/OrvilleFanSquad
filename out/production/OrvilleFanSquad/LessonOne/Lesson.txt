*** Lesson One
The goal of this lesson is to get you to code your first calculator

* First look

Words in orange are Java keywords, I'll tell you what they mean as we need to use them
A common problem I have with Java tutorials is spending a lesson on describing what "public static void" means
Don't worry about it
In the program there will be a lot of *syntax* you don't need to worry about for now, such as {}, [], ().
    I'll teach you what those mean later, I'm trying to gear these lessons more towards "doing"
    and don't want to overwhelm anyone with superfluous information that you can't see what it's doing.

Lines that begin '//' are commented out lines, which means the program doesn't bother to read them
They're notes for developers

The yellow words are called *methods*
    A method is the Java term for "a set of instructions for the program to execute"
    The first method of the program is called 'main', the second being 'helloWorld', yada yada
    I'm going to use the word method a lot, that's what I'm talking about


* Running your first Program
1. helloWorld
Instructions: Click the green arrow in the gutter on <line 4> that has the word "main" to run your first method, helloWorld
   to run your program!
   When below I say "Run the program" what I mean is click that green arrow
Result: A panel at the bottom of the screen, called the console, should open that says "Hello World!"
What is happening:
    The line System.out.println is an instruction to the program which means "Print what is in the double quotes"
    We'll be using it a lot
Fun note: Traditionally the first program everyone writes is called Hello World
    It's like the first program ever written or something like that and it just stuck around
    Whenever a developer learns a new language, first thing they do is just called "Writing Hello World"
        instead of saying "Wrote my first program"

2. helloName
Instructions: In the method helloName, replace the word 'myName' with your name.
    Or whatever you want I don't care lol
    In the main method, comment out the line that says helloWorld() and uncomment the line that says helloName()
    What you're doing here is telling the program to run the code in the method helloName instead of helloWorld
Result: A line should be printed in the console below that says "Hello " and then whatever you replaced myName with

3. helloWorld AND helloName
Instructions: Uncomment the method helloWorld in the main method and keep the line helloName uncommented
    Run the program
Result: You should see two lines printed out, the first saying "Hello World"
    The second line should be the "Hello " and then whatever you replaced myName with
This is important to see, in Java lines of code are all executed chronologically.
    No matter how many times you run this program, the main method will run the line before it and then the line after it
    Not every programming language does this
        I hate javascript, it /basically/ runs all the lines at once.

4. printFirstInt
What is happening:
    int myInt = 69
        int is a java keyword to declare a *variable* that is an Integer
        An "int" variable can be any number (69, 420, etc)
        This line calls the Integer "myInt".  You can change myInt to whatever you like, it doen't matter what you call it
        The purpose of variables is to reference whatever it was assigned
    System.out.println(myInt)
        This line means "print the variable myInt"
        Note that myInt doesn't go in double quotes.  You don't need those for variables
Instructions:
    Edit the main method so that the function only prints "69".
    Change 69 to a different number so it only prints that number
    Rename the variable myInt to whatever you'd like, can you get the program to print out the number you assigned it to?

5. operators
An operator is one of the basic functions on a calculator
    + -> Addition
    - -> Subtraction
    * -> Multiplication
    / -> Division
What is happening:
    Create an Integer called addendOne and assign it the value of 10
    Create an Integer called addendTwo and assign it to the value of 5
    Create an Integer called sum which is assigned to be the value of addendOne plus addendTwo
    Print result
Instructions:
    Run the method operators without any edits, it should print out 15.
    On the third line of the method, replace the '+' with a '-' or '*'
        It should print out the correct math calculation
        Yes I know you already know what's going to happen, I encourage you to play around with this to get familiar
            with editing code.  Hell I also encourage you to edit the variable names and run it again
            Practice is important and this is to help get a full understanding of what is happening and also
            help solidify it in memory.
    Try dividing 10 by 3 and print the result
        It should print out '3' instead of '3.33333...'
        There's a little trick you need to do for accurate division in Java, we'll get into it later

6. stringConcatenation
Concatenation is the Java term for adding a *String* or variable to another String
A String is the programming term for a line of text, in Java a String is always declared with double quotes
What is happening:
    The first line in the method is to declare a string called myString and assign it to the text "Hello World"
    The second line will print out "Hello".  Notice how because it is a variable you don't need the double quotes
    The following 3 System.out.println statements should all print out "Hello World".
        Can you follow along with the logic and understand why they all print the same thing even though
        what's in the parentheses are all different?

7. stringAndVariableConcatenation
When you add an int to a String (myString + myInt) the result is a concatenation of myString and myInt
The first line of the method will print out "Hello Nick, I have seen Zedd 5 times"
Instructions:
    Write a method that prints out that line exactly without using double quotes in the line System.out.println();
    Declare the number 5 as an int and don't cast it as an int
    Make sure it prints the second line exactly as it is written in the first
        Is there a place where there should be a space but isn't?

8. casting
*Casting* is the term for converting something of one type to another type
    In this method we'll be casting (converting) a String to an int
Why do we want to do this?
    Strings can be a number but Java recognizes it as text so you can't do math operations on it.
In Java, you cast a String to an int with the built-in Java method Integer.parseInt(myString)
    where myString can be any variable that is a String
What is happening:
    The first three lines creates two ints to print out simple addition
    The next three lines creates two Strings to show that when you try to add them you get String concatenation
    The next three lines casts the same strings from above to ints so you can use them for addition
Instructions:
    Create three Strings that are all text representations of Integers
    Cast all three Strings to ints
    Print out the sum of the integer representations for the three strings



9. scannerNextLine
A scanner is an *object* that reads user input typed into the console
Objects are the crux of what makes Java Java, hence why Java is called an Object Oriented Programming language
Objects will be a later lesson, so for now just know the line declares a Scanner object called scanner
What is happening:
    The second line prints the String "What is your name?"
    The third line tells the program to wait for the user to type something into the console
        and assigns to the variable nicksName
    Take note: The method nextLine() declared the user input as a String
Instructions:
    Run the method scanner.  The console should pop up if it's not there already
    You should see String "Who are you greeting?" printed in the console
    Click into the console, type Nick, and click enter
    The program should print out "Hello Nick"

    Add a line of code to print "What is your name?"
    Prompt the user for another input and assign it to a String called myName
    Print out the line "Hello Nick, my name is <your name here>"
Expected result printed to console when you're done:
    Who are you greeting?
    Nick
    What is your name?
    <your name here>
    Hi Nick, my name is <your name here>

10. scannerNextInt
In the previous method, we used the method nextLine() to read the user input as a String
For this we want to read the user input as an int.
Instructions:
    Write two lines of code to prompt the user for a number input using the method nextInt instead of nextLine
    and print out "You inputted the number <your number here>".

10. calculator
Write a calculator that does the addition calculator with user input
Instructions:
    Create a Scanner object (copy and past from scannerNextInt())
    Prompt the user with "What is the first number to add?" and assign it to a variable
    Prompt the user with "What is the second number to add?" and assign it to a variable
    Print out the sum of user's two inputs formatted as
        "<first number goes here> + <second number goes here> = <sum>"
